# Professional DEVELOPment Week: Markdown Resume Tips & Tricks!
## Learn how to write your resume in Markdown and host it on GitHub. Create a clean, readable, editable resume that is easy to share with recruiters!

### Getting Started
* What is Markdown?
* How can I make my resume in Markdown?
* How can I host my resume (or more) on a Github site?

### What is Markdown?
* Markdown is a language that you can use to format text on the web. It's more complicated than a plain .txt document, but less complicated than HTML.
* Markdown can be a great way to visualize some written word on the web. In Markdown you can make the text **bold**, <em>italicized</em>, ***both both AND italicized***, and much more! You can even use emojis :alien: :woman_astronaut: :earth_africa: :artificial_satellite:
* **<em>In fact</em>, this tutorial** is written in Markdown! You can check out what is looks like by going to edit the file (<em>hint: click on the pencil icon up on the right!</em>)
* Getting started <em>with</em> Markdown
  * GitHub has a basic guide to Markdown's syntax [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  * A more in-depth guide to Markdown, covering topics both basic and extended can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs).
  * We'll be using information from both these guides to help build our resume today.

### How can I make my resume in Markdown?
* Things you will need:
     - [x] [A GitHub account](https://github.com/)
     - [x] Information for your resume
#### Step 1: Making a place on GitHub for your resume
If you're new to GitHub, have no fear! In order to start the process for hosting your resume on here, you need to create a new repository. You can do that by clicking the new button up here at the top of the page, circled in red in the image below. You can also see a step-by-step guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

</p>

From here, you can name your repository. I recommend that you name it something straight to the point, like "resume" or "yourname_resume". That way, it's easier to remember what's in there. Also, make sure that the repository is set to **Public**, so that people can see it!
<p align="center">

    <img src="./photos/repo_name_public.JPG" width=400 align="center">
  </kbd>
</p>

Create your repository and add a new file. This is where we will create the resume in Markdown. 
<p align="center">
  <kbd>
    <img src="./photos/new_repo_file.JPG" width=400 align="center">
  </kbd>
</p>

Next, name the file "README.md" the "README" section makes it so that it shows up automatically when people look at th file here on GitHub. The ".md" section tells GutHub to make this a Markdown file.

Now you have a place to get started on the resume!

#### Step 2: Making the resume in Markdown
* There are a lot of great examples online of resume templates in markdown that you can use if you don't want to start from scratch.
  * [This is a simple, easy to fill-in version](https://github.com/habpippin/professional-development/blob/main/resume_template.md)
  * [This example uses code blocks as a way to highlight projects](https://github.com/aonemd/markdown-resume-template/blob/master/resume.md)
  * [This example has a nice use of line breaks to separate sections](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mszep/d3235240cc6653d6eeaa/raw/5904b5dc0e19b983fab48b1398057b707dd6d696/resume) 
  * You can look for more templates online, or even look into the Markdown language and start from scratch! Using different text sizes, line breaks, and lists can make a great resume unique to your own style.

If you're using a template, paste the text in your README.md file and edit the information to match that on your own resume. Add and delete sections as necessay for your experience, skills, etc. (<em>Hint: If you use the preview function up at the top of your file, you can see what it looks like in real-time!</em>)

Here is an example of my resume using a template [(You can check it out here)](https://github.com/britnaybeaudry/resume_template)

### How can I host my resume (or more) on a Github site?
If you want to go even further, you can even host your resume as its own site on GitHub. It's called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
With GitHub pages, you can also incorporate HTML and CSS elements. You can make your resume even more complex, add things <em>other</em> than just your resume link a bio, blog posts, and more! The choices are yours.
 
Here are some exmaples of excellent personal websites hosted on GitHub pages:
  *

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is GitHub's guide on getting started with your own GitHub page.

#### A whole website seeming like too much right now? 
A simpler idea is to modify your own GitHub profile to showcase you and your skills with a profile README. It's a great way to attract recruiters to your profile before they even see your code (you can even just add your resume to your profile if you want!). 
Here are some examples of cool profile READMEs if you need inspiration
   * [Jason Lengstorf's profile](https://github.com/jlengstorf)
   * [Cassidy Williams' profile](https://github.com/cassidoo)
   * [Donavon West's profile](https://github.com/donavon)
   * [Cyris' profile](https://github.com/CyrisXD)
   * Here's [my own](https://github.com/britnaybeaudry) that I created after following the tutorial below!
